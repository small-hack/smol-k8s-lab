[PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/) is a Free and Open Source social media networking platform based on [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/).

We are mostly stable for running PeerTube on Kubernetes. Check out our [PeerTube Argo CD ApplicationSet](https://github.com/small-hack/argocd-apps/tree/main/peertube/small-hack):

There's also additional services and pods outside of that flow. pods masotdon-web-app-media and masotdon-web-app-sidekiq have no children. 2 elastic search services have the same elastic search pod child. and then there's an additional 3 matching elastic search service and pod pairs">

## Required Init Values

To use the default `smol-k8s-lab` Argo CD Application, you'll need to provide one time init values for:

- `admin_user`
- `admin_email`
- `smtp_user`
- `smtp_host`
- `smtp_port`

## Required ApplicationSet Values

And you'll also need to provide the following values to be templated for your personal installation:

- `hostname` - the hostname for your web interface

## Required Sensitive Values

If you'd like to setup SMTP, we need a bit more sensitive data. This includes your SMTP password, S3 backup credentials, and restic repo password.

You have two options. You can:

- respond to a one-time prompt for these credentials (one-time _per cluster_)
- export an environment variable

### Environment Variables

You can export the following env vars and we'll use them for your sensitive data:

- `PEERTUBE_SMTP_PASSWORD`
- `PEERTUBE_S3_BACKUP_ACCESS_ID`
- `PEERTUBE_S3_BACKUP_SECRET_KEY`
- `PEERTUBE_RESTIC_REPO_PASSWORD`


# Example Config

```yaml
apps:
  peertube:
    description: |
       [link=https://joinpeertube.org/]PeerTube[/link] is an open source self hosted video hosting platform, similar to YouTube.

       smol-k8s-lab supports initializing peertube, by setting up your hostname, SMTP credentials, admin credentials, valkey credentials, postgresql credentials, and an admin user credentials. We pass all credentials as Secrets in the namespace and optionally save them to Bitwarden.

       smol-k8s-lab also creates a local s3 endpoint and as well as S3 bucket and credentials if you enable set peertube.argo.secret_keys.s3_provider to "minio" or "seaweedfs". Both seaweedfs and minio require you to specify a remote s3 endpoint, bucket, region, and accessID/secretKey so that we can make sure you have remote backups.

       To provide sensitive values via environment variables to smol-k8s-lab use:
         - PEERTUBE_SMTP_PASSWORD
         - PEERTUBE_S3_BACKUP_ACCESS_ID
         - PEERTUBE_S3_BACKUP_SECRET_KEY
         - PEERTUBE_RESTIC_REPO_PASSWORD
         - PEERTUBE_ADMIN_PASSWORD
